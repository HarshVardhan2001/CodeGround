[**CodeGround**](https://ide.judge0.com) is a free and open-source online code editor that allows you to write and execute code from a rich set of languages. It's perfect for anybody who just wants to quickly write and run some code without opening a full-featured IDE on their computer. Moreover, it is also useful for teaching and learning or just trying out a new language.

CodeGround is using [**Judge0**](https://api.judge0.com) for executing user's source code.
